The Fluent Chatbot project represents a concerted effort to elevate information services for students within the Computer Science department at the University of Brawijaya. In my role as a chatbot model developer, I actively participate in data collection and development processes, adhering to the principles of Agile methodology. My responsibilities extend to the critical analysis of user needs and the suitability of proposed solutions. This collaborative effort involves close coordination with both the project team and supervising professors.

The ongoing nature of the project underscores its dedication to crafting a highly effective chatbot tailored to meet the unique information service requirements of the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of Brawijaya. Technologically, the project leverages advanced tools, including Machine Learning, TF-IDF, and Python, to ensure the chatbot's robust functionality and intelligence in providing relevant and accurate information. This multifaceted approach aligns with the project's ultimate goal of significantly enhancing the information services available to students in the Computer Science domain.

**Role of ML (Naive Bayes and TF-IDF):**
In the realm of Machine Learning, Naive Bayes plays a pivotal role by enabling the chatbot to classify and understand the context of user inputs, enhancing the precision of responses. Additionally, the implementation of TF-IDF provides a sophisticated analysis of the importance of words in text, contributing to the chatbot's ability to evaluate and respond to user queries with greater accuracy. Together, these ML techniques empower the chatbot to navigate diverse conversational contexts, offering a more intelligent and contextually aware information service to Computer Science students.
